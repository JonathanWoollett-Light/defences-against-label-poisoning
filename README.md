# Defences against label poisoning
An illustration of 2 basic defences against gathering inaccurately labelled data.

## Intro

1. For many problems, we must gather data
2. Gathered data may be inaccurate, possibly maliciously so
3. Thus we should implement techniques to defend against inaccurare training data damaging our models.
4. Here I present 2 basic but surprisingly effective techniques.

## Results

They may not be visible in the `.ipynb` so I've stuck them here aswell.
